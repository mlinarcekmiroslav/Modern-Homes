April challenge in Project : Classroom school of programming

This project was part of april challenge in Project : Classroom school of programming. In coding this webpage I used HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. This webpage has header part including heading (logo) and navigation bar, main part with 5 sections including photo gallery and one form, and footer part including social media icon links. In building layout for project I combined flexbox and css grid. Every part of this webpage is fully responsive.
